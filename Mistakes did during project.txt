1. The first mistake was font was not getting applied at all to the website, the mistake occurred due to because I directly downloaded the font of website using the network tab. And after that, I converted it using ".ttf" file. When I tried to apply it, it wasn't working at all. Then I thought I will resolve this problem in future, as I thought it's not a huge problem. Even after completing the one hour section of the instructors video, I was still clueless on how to apply the font even I did everything as he did it. At first I thought there has to be some errors in my code, but it turns out the file I downloaded was broken and hence the reason why it was malfunctioning. So the lesson I learned here is: 
- Always make sure to download the files from authorized and big website, as the chances of font being broken is close to null.
- Always make sure that the files which you're downloading are not broken, you'll spend countless amount of time thinking that there will be some mistake in the code but when in reality the problem was broken file. 
2. Always have an browser which does not have any extension and whose default settings are not modified. A lot of time, modifications of setting & extension conflict with the output of website.
For ex: I have auto play set to off in chrome due to extension & in Firefox thereâ€™s a setting to turn off the auto play. Thus I was confused why auto play feature is not working, and after some time I figured out It was the extension & customized setting that was causing the conflict in the output.
